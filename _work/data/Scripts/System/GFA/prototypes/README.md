This directory contains intermediate prototype definitions.

This allows to change only these files in case of missing or renamed classes and leave the files in the Instances sub-directory untouched.  
That eases the maintenance of the scripts and also allows using submodules/symlinks for the Instances sub-directory, see README.md in the root directory.
