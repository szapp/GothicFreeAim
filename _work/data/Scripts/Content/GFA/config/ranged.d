/*
 * This function is called at the point of shooting a bow or a crossbow. The return value scales the gravity of the
 * projectile in percent, where 0 is fast gravity drop-off and 100 is the straightest shot possible. Regardless of the
 * percentage, however, all shots are impacted by gravity at the latest after GFA_TRAJECTORY_ARC_MAX milliseconds.
 * This function is also well-suited to be used by the other functions of this file defined below.
 *
 * Ideas: incorporate factors like e.g. a quick-draw talent, weapon-specific stats, ...
 * Check if bow or crossbow with (weapon.flags & ITEM_BOW) or (weapon.flags & ITEM_CROSSBOW).
 *
 * Here, for example, bows are scaled with longer draw time (how long has the bow been drawn), whereas crossbows are
 * scaled with shorter aiming time (how long was the aim held steady). This results in slower build up once per aiming
 * for bows and faster build up for crossbows, but restarts every time the mouse moves. Additionally, crossbows have
 * recoil, see GFA_GetRecoil() below. All of this is a design choice and can be changed in the functions in this file.
