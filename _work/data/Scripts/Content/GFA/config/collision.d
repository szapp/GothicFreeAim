/*
 * This file contains all configurations for collision behaviors and hit registration of projectiles.

 * Requires the feature GFA_CUSTOM_COLLISIONS (see config\settings.d).

 * List of included functions:

 *  func int GFA_GetCollisionWithWorld(C_Npc shooter, C_Item weapon, int materials, string textures)
 */


/*
 * This function is called every time an NPC is hit (positive hit!) by a projectile (arrows and bolts). It can be used
 * to define the collision behavior (or disabling hit registration) on NPCs based on different criteria.
 * The parameter 'material' holds the material of the armor (of the target), -1 for no armor equipped. For armors of
 * NPCs the materials are defined as in Constants.d (MAT_METAL, MAT_WOOD, ...).
 *
 * Note: Unlike most other config functions, this function is also called for NPC shooters!
 *
 * Note: If GFA_TRUE_HITCHANCE == true, this function is called for ALL hits (all hits are positive hits).
 *       If GFA_TRUE_HITCHANCE == false, this function is called for POSITIVE hits only.
 *
 * Ideas: 'ineffective' ranged weapons, armor materials immune to arrows, disable friendly-fire, maximum range, ...
 * Examples are written below and commented out and serve as inspiration of what is possible.
