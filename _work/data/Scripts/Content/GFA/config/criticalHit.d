/*
 * This function is called every time (any kind of) NPC is hit by a projectile (arrows and bolts). Originally it was
 * meant to design critical hits based on a specific bone of the model, but it can also be used to change the damage
 * (or to trigger any other kind of special events) based on any bone of the model that was hit. Additionally, it allows
 * to specify a "damage behavior". The damage behavior defines how much damage is eventually applied to the victim. This
 * allows, e.g. to prevent a victim from dying, and instead knock it out with one shot (see examples in function).
 * This function is only called if free aiming is enabled. For critical hits without free aiming see
 * GFA_GetCriticalHitAutoAim() below.
 *
 * The damage value is a float and represents the new base damage (damage of weapon), not the final damage!
 * All possible damage behaviors are defined in _intern/const.d (GFA_DMG_*).
 *
 * Note: This function is specific to free aiming. For critical hits without free aiming see GFA_GetCriticalHitAutoAim()
 *       below.
 *
 * Ideas: incorporate weapon-specific stats, head shot talent, special knockout munition, dependency on target, ...
 * Examples are written below and commented out and serve as inspiration of what is possible.
 *
 * Here, preliminary critical hits for almost all Gothic 1 and Gothic 2 monsters are defined (all head shots).
